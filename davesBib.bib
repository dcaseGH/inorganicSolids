abstract  ="The structural features of intercalated Li3AlxTi2-x(PO4)3 compounds{,} with x = 0 and 0.2{,} have been deduced by Rietveld analysis of neutron diffraction (ND) patterns recorded between 100 and 500 K. The Li insertion decreases the symmetry from R[3 with combining macron]c to R[3 with combining macron] in analyzed compounds. In pristine Li1+xAlxTi2-x(PO4)3 samples{,} Li occupies mainly six-fold M1 sites at ternary axes; but in lithiated Li3AlxTi2-x(PO4)3 samples{,} Li is located near M2 positions at M3/M3[prime or minute] four-fold coordinated sites. In both cases{,} Li arrangement minimizes electrostatic Li-Li repulsions. The insertion of lithium resulted in the reduction of Ti4+ to Ti3+ that shifts 7Li{,} 27Al and 31P MAS-NMR resonances towards more positive chemical shifts{,} improving the resolution of different sites. The detection of twelve components in 7Li MAS-NMR spectra recorded at room temperature suggests the location of Li+ ions at three-oxygen faces that define M2 cavities. From 7Li MAS-NMR spectra{,} the occupancy of sites and mobility of lithium were investigated in the temperature range 100-500 K. The correlation between structural information{,} deduced by neutron diffraction{,} and lithium mobility{,} deduced by NMR spectroscopy{,} provides new insights into structural factors that affect lithium mobility in materials with NASICON structure."}
